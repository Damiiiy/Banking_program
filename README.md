# Banking_program
this is a little banking program that basically creates a new user when necessary and also allows users to login into their banking dashboard.
When a user logs in, it allows the user to perform two processes. which are:
1. Make a deposit into their account and get an alert in a text file. This text file will hold all the alerts for the deposit transaction for all users.
2. Make a withdrawal from their balance; after this, it also gets an alert into another text file that holds all alert for making a withdrawal
